## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Optional Features** — CLI (`cli`) and HTTP server (`serve`) are now optional Cargo features, enabling lightweight library builds without clap/axum/tokio/serde dependencies
- **ZPL Diff Auto-Fix Skill** — New `.claude/skills/zpl-diff-auto-fix/SKILL.md` for automated rendering diff reduction
- **Font Q and Font S Support** — Added ZPL test fixtures for Font Q and Font S with normal and rotated styles

### Fixed

- **CP850 Encoding** — Corrected byte 0xA9 mapping to ® and added mappings for 0xA6–0xAF range

### Changed

- **Dependency Reduction** — clap, axum, tokio, and serde are now optional, feature-gated behind `cli`/`serve` features
- **Conditional Compilation** — `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs` refactored with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` attributes

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Web Playground** — Built-in browser UI served at `GET /` with ZPL/EPL editor, Labelary-style inch-based label size presets (4×6, 4×4, 4×3, 2×4, 2×2, 3.5×1.5, Custom), inline PNG preview, and one-click PNG/PDF download buttons
- **Open File Support** — Folder icon button in the playground opens a native file picker for `.zpl`/`.epl` files; format selector auto-detects from file extension
- **`labels_dir()` / `unit_dir()` Test Helpers** — Added render helper functions for consistent test data directory resolution across all test suites
- **Release Version Skill** — Reusable `.github/skills/release-version/SKILL.md` skill for cutting reproducible releases

### Fixed

- **`debug_usps_text` Path** — Updated hardcoded test path after testdata reorganization

### Changed

- **Test Data Reorganization** — Split ZPL test fixtures into `testdata/labels/` (carrier/real-world) and `testdata/unit/` (synthetic) subdirectories; flattened snippets into `unit/`; renamed `_ref.png` files to golden PNG convention
- **Dual Diff Reports** — Split the single diff report into two: `testdata/diffs/diff_report_labels.txt` and `testdata/diffs/diff_report_unit.txt` with separate canvas dimensions
- **README Render Comparison** — Updated section with current diff statistics and Labelary comparison gallery
- **Documentation** — Improved clarity of rendering instructions, test assertions, and AGENTS.md workflow documentation

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Commit Message Guidance** — Added commit message guidelines for the ZPL diff auto-fix workflow

### Fixed

- **MaxiCode ECC Pipeline** — Rewrote MaxiCode encoding with proper GF(64) Reed-Solomon ECC handling
- **MaxiCode Encode Call Site** — Updated encoder call signatures to pass the required mode parameter
- **QR Payload Parsing (`^BQ`)** — Strips `|` separators in QR payloads to match Zebra and Labelary behavior
- **Code 128 Mode N (`^BC`)** — Corrected mode-N data handling and display text behavior to better align with ZPL expectations
- **Text Glyph Rendering** — Render `®` (U+00AE) as superscript in text fields for closer visual parity

### Changed

- **Renderer Cleanup** — Improved readability in renderer formatting paths
- **Golden Calibration** — Tuned bitmap font sizes and golden-test tolerance values to improve comparison accuracy

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **ZPL Diff Auto-Fix Skill** — New `src/skill/` module with data models, diff classification, diff scanning, and element-level contribution analysis for automated ZPL rendering improvement
- **UCC/GS1 Mode for `^BC`** — Code 128 barcode mode `D` now correctly prepends FNC1, strips parentheses and spaces, and converts `>8` escape sequences to embedded FNC1 separators per ZPL spec
- **QR Code UCC Mode** — Implemented UCC mode data preparation and improved error correction level handling for `^BQ`
- **USPS Priority Mail ZPL labels** — Added USPS test labels (Priority Mail and Test Merchant) to the golden test suite

### Fixed

- **Rotated Text Positioning** — Corrected `get_text_top_left_pos` for 90° and 270° rotations in the renderer
- **`^BC` GS1 Barcode Encoding** — Fixed GS1-128 (mode `D`) to handle embedded AI separators (`>8`) and strip grouping characters from the encoding string
- **QR Code Quiet Zone** — Fixed quiet zone handling for QR codes to match Labelary reference output
- **CI: Clippy warnings** — Resolved `empty-line-after-doc-comments`, `dead-code`, `ptr-arg`, and `needless-range-loop` warnings in `src/skill/`

### Changed

- **Code Refactor** — Improved readability and maintainability across renderer and parser modules
- **Diff Thresholds** — Updated per-label tolerance thresholds for DHL Parcel IT, BRT IT, and USPS labels



### Added

- **Render Comparison Gallery** — Added side-by-side comparison images for 6 major carriers (Amazon, FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS, Swiss Post) in README
- **MIT License File** — Added LICENSE file with full MIT license text

### Fixed

- **Bash 3 Compatibility** — Fixed case-insensitive comparison in CLI E2E test for macOS default Bash 3
- **License Link** — Fixed broken `../LICENSE` reference in README to point to `LICENSE`
